            The company is delivering sample management software to the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world. I was responsible development and maintenance of the software, especially in terms of system integration (integration with vendors + developing REST APIs). Also, I've been responsible for the technical evaluation in the recruitment process and slightly engaged in company's IT administration.

            The company is holding one of the biggest databases containing information about debts and debtors. I was responsible for maintaining and developing SoA applications. This was my first commercial experience during BSc studies and it turned out to be difficult to simultaneously work and study back then.
